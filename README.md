# ICSnap

## How it works

1. Use Metamask Flask to hold a Snap Wallet with IC defined identity(Secp256k1). --- IC identity with metamask
2. Use that identity to sign message and act as a device added to II/AstroX ME. --- Use II/AstroX login paradigm
3. Use II/AstroX ME to login to wallet as controller, can send ICP use ledger canister. --- Canister hold/transfer ICP
4. This wallet canister is also an ECDSA threshold wallet, hold a ECDSA publickey --- Canister hold ECDSA publickey
5. Use frontend to construct an ETH transaction, and use ECDSA threshold to sign and broadcast to ETH network --- ICP as multicoin wallet
